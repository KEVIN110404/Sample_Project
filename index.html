    <p>An internship experience may be a requirement for a variety of different college education programs, and if you've recently completed a required internship, you may also consider writing a reflection paper. An internship reflection can allow you to describe your unique experience and how that experience can support your academic or professional development. Even though it can seem challenging to convey this experience in writing, there are several ways you can do this effectively. <br> 

        In this article, we explore why you may write an internship reflection essay, explain how to write one and offer a basic essay template and example to guide you through writing your reflection.</p>

        <p>An internship is a professional learning experience that offers meaningful, practical work related to a studentâ€™s field of study or career interest. An internship gives a student the opportunity for career exploration and development, and to learn new skills. It offers the employer the opportunity to bring new ideas and energy into the workplace, develop talent and potentially build a pipeline for future full-time employees.</p>
